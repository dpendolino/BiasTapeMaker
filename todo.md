## Version 0.4

# Completed Version 0.4
  * widen base
  * move circleTabs farther from folds
  * Loosen up the slots
  * shift first mini-guide up to right after slide end tabs (Can't go all the way up - need a bridge))
  * set miniGuides relative to slide, tabs
  * Add wall tabs inside mini guide slots
  * widen fabric slots
# TODO
  * note over/under fabric path
  * Make vertical positioning more adaptive.

# Completed Version 0.3
* Cleanup guides.js
* Separate into different .js files for easier maintenance
* Slide
  * Fold lines - whole length from slideStart to just before last cutouts
  * get rid of second set of splitter tabs
  * reduce splitter tab cut to 0.5*hGuideSep
  * Make slide longer
  * replace slide tabs with regular splitter tab (can I edit the path afterward to move the top cut end point?)
  * Add indicator of where to reinforce with tape (slide tabs and lower end of slide)
* Guide
  * Sharper angle at the top - angle for maybe only 2*hGuideSep
  * Widen cutout to make more room for the slide - outset by probably 2x or 3x inner.
  * --shorten 2nd and 3rd bottomCutout to leave a 1.5" long strip for the fabric to go over--
  * Remove third bottomCutout
  * Can these cutouts turn into mini guides, with offset slits to allow the fold to come up above?
* General
  * Make circle tabs larger (2x)
  * 4 circle tabs instead of 5
  * circle tab placement seemed good
